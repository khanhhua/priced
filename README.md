# Foreword

Managing product pricing, taxation, promotions.. must accommodate the element of human creativity. Such system should, if not must, be developed in an imperative manner. You cannot and should not implement one with compiled languages alone. Should you ever complete, you would end up with a modular monolith, allowing zero extensibility.

A DSL must be introduced. Let's work on that.
